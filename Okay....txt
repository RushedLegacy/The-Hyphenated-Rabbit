Let's do this.

I'm never gonna finish an idea I don't put onto paper, well "paper".

And I'm never gonna keep at it without you guys to hold me to it.

"Gritty realism will only take you so far J. I'm telling you right now, you need Fantasy! You know? Really Sci-fi that shit."

"Man, I've written one word. One. I already feel like I'm embodying the stereotypical Writer who doesn't have inspiration."

"Stereotypes are largely based on reality, ya' know. Hell, in a stereotypical, hypothetical situation, I, being the lowly

 sometimes."

"If the best you can come up with is fucking AI buggering Humanity-"

"How about Plain-Song?"

"......that... that might work. Wonderfully, actually. But-" "I know, We promised." "Yeah.. this just turned serious, huh?"

"Well, *That* temporal blackhole of a job isn't gonna suddenly seem inviting again after all these years, might as well
 commit to this."

"No arguments there..... All I'm saying though, is that I'm not gonna be the sheep getting buggered here." "But-" "Nope.
NOPE." "She always liked you mo-" "Fuck you." "Fine. Gimme your phone then." "...this is a bad idea."
